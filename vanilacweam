[ Most of Cream / Cupcake's info can be found on the pronoun.cc page on my account (PikoPikoHammer), but will still leave stuff here just incase you come across this first. :3 ]

Cream's little age is 3-4 years old, so a VERYYY young child, please be mindful with what you say to her, most things she may not understand, or some things might scare her. 
Cream usually appears when something bad happens, so interact with A LOT of care! There will be the occasional time where she's there just because she wants to be!!


Please avoid :
Any mentions of cream's mother, Vanilla.
 - She doesn't know where her mother is, which is very scary for her, and if reminded can cause her to panic without her mother :(
Any mentions of EXE's / EXE games...
- It's already bad enough that's she's in them. It scares her a lot :( [There are VERY specific Exe's she'll be around but that's different.. Coughs]
Any mentions of school (UNLESS she brings it up herself)
- She doesn't like school, especially since the one we go to is NOTTT at her level at ALLLL..
ANY MENTIONS OF SOMEONE NAMED HALINA / ELLIOT. 
- PLEASE NO IT SNAPS US RIGHT OUT OF LITTLESPACE.
Any negative emotion DIRECTED TOWARDS her. (Yelling [negative caps lock], being angry at her)
- Will make her sad, try to talk to her gently if she does something wrong :(
Vegetables.
- Cream does not like vegetables. UNLESS it's a carrot. We love carrots around here!! At least she does. Perosnally I don't like carrorts that much but this isn't about me!!!
Reminding her about actual age (18)
- Shhhh let the girl exist in peace!!!!!!

----
Cream does NOT speak VERBALLY at all, but when it comes to typing she'll do her own thing! BUT, a lot of the time she's most non-scribal, instead shows her thoughts through emojis or actions!!
VERY sleepy. Can and WILL fall asleep like 1 minute into being regressed ðŸ’”

If there are any questionns, please try to ask me (Amy!!) since cream cant exactly answer for herself . 3:
